# Slidesmart

The fast-paced education system today burdens educators with hours of work. Researching, teaching, designing courses, marking papers takes up most of their time. Providing them with a useful tool to assist their presentations is crucial.

We thus ended up building Slidesmart through which educators can leverage the power of being able to encapsulate long videos and texts such as blog posts and research papers into crisp, accurate, and visually appealing summaries in the form of slides.
